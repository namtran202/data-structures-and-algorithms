# Sliding window
- Approach for solving problems that involve finding a subarray or substring that meets certain criteria
- Maintaining a window that slides over the array or string, expanding or contracting as needed to find the desired result
- Useful for problems related to sums, averages, and conditions within subarrays or substrings
- Reduce Time complexity from O(n<sup>2</sup>) to O(n)
