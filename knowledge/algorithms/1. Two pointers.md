# Two pointers:
- A commonly used approach in problems involving arrays and linked lists
- Involves using two pointers (or indices) to traverse the array (or list) from different directions or at different speeds
    - One slow-runner and the other fast-runner
    - One pointer starts from the beginning while the other pointer starts from the end
- Useful for solving problems related to searching, sorting, and finding pairs or subarrays that meet certain conditions
